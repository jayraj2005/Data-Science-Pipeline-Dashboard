# 🤖 AI EDA Assistant

A smart Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) assistant that automates data profiling, visualization, and summarization using Python and AI-powered tools.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is designed to assist data scientists and analysts by automating the most common EDA tasks. With just a few lines of code, the assistant can generate data summaries, detect nulls, display feature distributions, correlations, and offer insights using natural language.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy** – For data manipulation and statistical calculations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For plotting and visualizations
- **Streamlit** – To build an interactive web interface
- **YData Profiling** – For automatic EDA reports
- **scikit-learn** – For preprocessing and basic ML utilities

---

## 📄 What's Inside

- `app.py`  
  The Streamlit application that powers the assistant.

- `eda_tools.py`  
  Custom Python script for handling EDA logic and feature generation.

- `requirements.txt`  
  Python dependencies required to run the application:
  ```
  streamlit
  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  ydata-profiling
  scikit-learn
  ```

- `sample_datasets/`  
  Includes example datasets you can use to test the tool.
